# D3 Homework 

Using the D3 techniques taught in class, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. You'll code this graphic in the `app.js` file of your homework directoryâ€”make sure you pull in the data from `data.csv` by using the `d3.csv` function. 
* Include state abbreviations in the circles.
* Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

CSS files - used to control the formatting for the HTML and d3 functions
data.csv - raw data used in chart
app.js - json used to call data, create charts, and load data to them
index.html - html file calling the app.js and CSS files to render the page
